TODO: a list or queue or other structure to allow sounds started from a script
      to play fully, but still be properly freed

TODO: add per area (maybe per battle?) specifiable battle background image.
      maybe just allow setting it via a scripting command?

TODO: change map loader so that tile numbers don't signify the fileame
      directly, but 'translate' to a name (per area specified) that
      is easier to work w/ (sand.png instead of 123.png) and reduce
      the map collision to 1 or 0 (solid or non-collidable)
DONE: a tilelist is now specified after the enemylist. tilelist is in the
      format of the tile_id_num (like 021) w/ or w/ out the leading zero or
      leading spaces, followed by 1 space and the rest of that line (up to 99
      chars long) is taken as the tile's graphic filename (example:
      '021 tiles/sand.png')

TODO: sort objects by areaname->layer in objects list and update
      functions to take advantage of that

TODO: more efficient image data usage (don't load the same image 20
      times for 20 copies of the object, but don't create memory leaks
      or crashes)

TODO: support for animated objects in map file format (preferrably not
      just another section for them, but use them in the same section
      as normal objects)
DONE: loader now checks the extension of the specified objects. if it
      ends in '.anim' it is loaded as an animated object, otherwise
      it defaults to regular objects (though, it will warn if the
      object filename does not end in '.object')

TODO: rewrite/extend scripting components or embed a real scripting
      language like squirrel/lua/ruby.
      most things could currently be hacked in by using special variables
      (for example, to set the battle background image) however, it feels
      like to much of a cop-out.

TODO: map/level editor. (tile (and object) placement at the least)

TODO: save game system.

TODO: maybe add right-click (mouse) to move next to a tile/object,
      face the proper direction and activate it

TODO: maybe add joystick support

TODO: non-perfect grid aligned movement and adjustments (like the original Zelda)
