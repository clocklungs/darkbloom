BUG: bottom player in battle mode extends beyond bottom of screen (that is,
     the feet get cut off a little). should be moved up (and left?) to
     ensure the entire image is visible.

BUG: idle animations for animatedobjects not updated when walking (maybe only
     when walking fast?). may be true for all animatedobject animations.
FIX: this was from using a static variable in a class method. apparently the
     variable is shared w/ all instances of a class when you do that. doh!

BUG: only one enemy will attack in a battle (if you kill it, another will)
     and they will only attack the first two (top two) players, unless
     they are dead.

BUG: battles do not end when everyone dies.

BUG: dead player can still attack enemies in battle mode (if the
     player was selected before they died)
