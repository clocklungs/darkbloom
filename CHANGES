    collisions in Object.move()

  -removed: world_graphics directory, old (numbered) maps. replaced
    world_graphics images w/ named images (like grass.png) in tiles
    directory
  -added: Path class (part of base Object class) to handle NPC routes
    currently there is no way to add a path, since i haven't decided
    how exactly they should be specified (relative/absolute, from a
    script or from a file, should they have delays? should they
    execute scripts when you reach the waypoint?)

Fri Aug 12 11:36:52 EDT 2005
  -added: Object::move() function to handle the moving of an object
    along a path. (currently it just moves the object as far as the
    move_stack tells it to, since there is no path information. (only
    the player's mouse navigation currently uses this)

Thu Aug 11 12:11:49 EDT 2005
  -added: segfault caused by attempting to insert animated objects
    into the ObjectLayerList in the middle AND at the end if they were
    supposed to go in the middle.

    into the ObjectLayerList in the middle AND at the end if they were
    supposed to go in the middle.

    as part of the map/level format)

    file format (they must end in .anim however)

Fri Aug  5 13:32:11 EDT 2005

  -idle animation frame interval temporarily hardcoded at 250ms until
    per frame intervals are added to the animated object format, and
    the movement animation frame interval to 100ms
  -mouse clicks while walking to a tile, set the new tile as the
    destination (you can change direction before you walk all the way)
